# TODO-SSR (Todo Server-side Rendering at home)
A simple fullstack Todo app built with **React**, **Express**, and **JSON file storage**, designed to explore what happens under the hood of **Next.js**. This project simulates a fullstack environment without using any database or high-level frameworks, to help understand routing, API handling, static file serving, and local Docker deployment — all manually crafted.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- React (Vite)
- Node.js + Express
- JSON file as data storage
- Docker (single container)

🎯 Goal:
- Learn how fullstack apps work behind the scenes.
- Understand the core concepts that Next.js abstracts away.
- Practice building a production-like app with manual control.
